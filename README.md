# Data Processing Project\n\nThis repository hosts a robust solution for processing tabular data using Python and Pandas, integrated with a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline powered by GitHub Actions. The goal is to provide a reliable and automated way to transform raw Excel data into structured JSON output, ensuring code quality and automatic publication of results.\n\n## Table of Contents\n- [Features](#features)\n- [Project Structure](#project-structure)\n- [Setup and Installation](#setup-and-installation)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n- [CI/CD Workflow](#ci-cd-workflow)\n- [License](#license)\n- [Contact](#contact)\n\n## Features\n- **Automated Data Transformation**: Processes `data.xlsx` using a Python script (`execute.py`) to generate `result.json`.\n- **Python 3.11+ & Pandas 2.3+**: Ensures modern and efficient data handling.\n- **Code Quality Enforcement**: Integrates [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting, run automatically in CI.\n- **Continuous Integration/Deployment**: GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) automates testing, execution, and deployment.\n- **Result Publication**: Automatically publishes `result.json` to GitHub Pages for easy access.\n- **Single-file Responsive Web App**: An `index.html` file demonstrates a modern, responsive web interface built with Tailwind CSS.\n\n## Project Structure\n```\n.\n├── .github/              # GitHub Actions workflows\n│   └── workflows/\n│       └── ci.yml        # CI/CD pipeline for linting, execution, and deployment\n├── data.xlsx             # Input Excel data file\n├── execute.py            # Python script for data processing\n├── index.html            # Responsive web application (this is just the web UI for the project, not part of the data processing)\n├── LICENSE               # MIT License\n├── README.md             # Project README\n└── data.csv              # Converted CSV data (generated or committed)\n```\n*Note: `result.json` is generated by the CI workflow and published via GitHub Pages; it is not committed to the repository.*\n\n## Setup and Installation\n\nTo get this project up and running locally, follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Clone the repository:**\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git\n    cd your-repo-name\n    ```\n\n2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**\n    ```bash\n    python -m venv .venv\n    # On Windows\n    .venv\\Scripts\\activate\n    # On macOS/Linux\n    source .venv/bin/activate\n    ```\n\n3.  **Install dependencies:**\n    The `execute.py` script requires `pandas`. You might also want `openpyxl` for reading `.xlsx` files and `ruff` for linting.\n    ```bash\n    pip install pandas openpyxl ruff\n    ```\n    Ensure you are using Python 3.11+ and Pandas 2.3+.\n\n## Usage\n\n1.  **Input Data:**\n    Place your Excel data in `data.xlsx` at the root of the repository.\n\n2.  **Run the processing script locally:**\n    ```bash\n    python execute.py > result.json\n    ```\n    This command will execute the Python script, process `data.xlsx`, and output the results into `result.json`.\n\n3.  **Convert `data.xlsx` to `data.csv` (if needed):**\n    The `execute.py` script might expect `data.csv` as input, or `data.xlsx` might be converted as a pre-processing step. Ensure `data.csv` is present if `execute.py` needs it.\n\n## CI/CD Workflow\n\nThe `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file defines the continuous integration and deployment pipeline:\n\n-   **Trigger**: The workflow runs on every `push` to the repository.\n-   **Environment**: Uses `ubuntu-latest` and sets up Python 3.11.\n-   **Steps**:\n    1.  **Checkout Code**: Retrieves the repository content.\n    2.  **Setup Python**: Configures Python 3.11.\n    3.  **Install Dependencies**: Installs `pandas`, `openpyxl`, and `ruff`.\n    4.  **Run Ruff Linter**: Checks the Python code for style and potential errors.\n        ```bash\n        ruff check .\n        ```\n    5.  **Run Ruff Formatter**: Ensures consistent code formatting.\n        ```bash\n        ruff format . --check\n        ```\n    6.  **Convert data.xlsx to data.csv**: If `execute.py` expects CSV, this step ensures `data.csv` is available. (This is a placeholder, actual conversion logic might be needed here or in `execute.py` if it handles `.xlsx` directly).\n    7.  **Execute Python Script**: Runs `execute.py` and redirects its output to `result.json`.\n        ```bash\n        python execute.py > result.json\n        ```\n    8.  **Upload result.json to GitHub Pages**: Uses `actions/upload-pages-artifact` to make `result.json` available for GitHub Pages deployment.\n    9.  **Deploy to GitHub Pages**: Utilizes `actions/deploy-pages` to publish the artifact.\n\nThe `result.json` will be accessible via your GitHub Pages URL (e.g., `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/result.json`) after a successful CI run.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.\n\n## Contact\n\nFor any questions or suggestions, please open an issue in this repository.
